Software for programming the F420 control unit scenarios of the Bticino Myhome

*What is it?*
This is a old software programmed in visual basic 6 for sending the frame own to program the F420, this project dosen't support authentication.
For the connection it is necessary that the webserver does not require a password for access.
if you are interested in getting in touch and updating it, it would be nice to have a new version supported by new devices.
I don't have time to rewrite the software with a new language, if you are interested you can publish the new developments.
